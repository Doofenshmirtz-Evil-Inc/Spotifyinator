    # ok so basically when you call a function it only knows that it exists, if youre importing it
    # so you have to give it specific data, this is alos useful when u calling it in different situations
    # for example lets say thers function math()

# if math has 2 numbers it multiplies them, but if it has 1 then it squares it
# so to do that math has to ask for some numbers
# def math(num1, num2):
#     if num2: # if we have 2 numbers
#         return num1 * num2
#     else:
#         return num1*num1

# right so basically no matter what, when you call math, the first number you give it is always num1 and the second is num2
# so i can call math(sex, bomb) and sex will equal num1 and bomb will equal num2
# understand? i bad at exmpalining this
# but how do you use that

# ok so you need the sp key or sp object or whatever right
# so you should pass that to all the functions as a paramater so you dont have to keep
# recreating it/requesting it from spotify

# so like you would want that to be declared/created when the media player starts so that
# u dont have to recreate it
# then the pausePlayback() and stuff would just request sp as a param
#ahhhh i see so i need to set it up where the functions get declared
# well that would be in a diff file so it wouldnt work since ur just importing the functions not sp

# well actually ur right, you need to set it up to request sp where the functions are declared
# but the actual sp object would be in this file, you just pass it to the functions

#how do you pass the object without just redoing it everytime

# you declare the object outside of where you pass it

#and then call it kinda like a function?
# well an object is just a complicated variable basically, just a peice of data, so you just
# give it to the function the same way you would a variable

#got it
